# Road-runner
I created my first game in class 8 using Unreal Engine 4, inspired by Subway Surfers. Itâ€™s an endless runner where players avoid obstacles, collect rewards, and power-ups while increasing speed. I focused on smooth controls, vibrant graphics, and fun mechanics, learning a lot about game development!
